## A. Branch and Feature Organization

The project has been divided into feature-based branches for modular development. Each branch represents a different feature or functionality in the system, making it easier to track changes and isolate components for development and testing.


### Steps to Review and Test Feature Branches

1. **Switch to a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```
   Replace `branch-name` with the specific feature branch you want to check out.

2. **Run tests**:
   Each feature branch should have unit tests to verify the correctness of the feature. Use Maven or your IDE's test tools to ensure everything works as expected.

3. **Merge and deploy**:
   Once a feature is complete and has passed testing, merge it into the main branch and deploy the updated version of the application.
